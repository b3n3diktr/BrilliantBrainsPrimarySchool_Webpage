                                "Brilliant Brains Nursery and Primary School" was established with 10 classrooms to
                                provide quality education in a conducive learning environment.

                                Orphans receive free education, uniforms, sportswear, school transport, breakfast, and
                                lunch. We also link them to international communities for sponsorship opportunities.

                                Phase 1 of the orphanage has been completed with roofing. Phase 2 is at the roofing level.
                                Our target is to accommodate more OVCs (Orphans and Vulnerable Children).

                                Paul &amp; Martha Medical and Maternity Centre was an ongoing project but was paused due to a
                                lack of resources and volunteers. We also plan to establish a Childrenâ€™s Clinic at Brilliant
                                Brains School to treat students who cannot go to the town hospital.

                                Electricity poles have been set up at the project site, and electricity is now connected to
                                the school. Every classroom now has its own lightbulb, which is a major achievement.

                                A water purification system has been procured, along with two water tanks of 10,000 liters
                                each, serving 400 children with fresh, clean water. This project was made possible through
                                a generous contribution from German VIA volunteers.
